        <p>In the arts and humanities, the use of computational, statistical, and mathematical approaches has considerably increased in recent years. This research is characterized by the use of formal methods and the construction of explicit, computational models. This includes quantitative, statistical approaches, but also more generally computational methods for processing and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these approaches. Despite the undeniable growth of this research area, many scholars still struggle to find suitable research-oriented venues to present and publish computational work that does not lose sight of traditional modes of inquiry in the arts and humanities. This is the scholarly niche that the CHR conference aims to fill. More precisely, the conference aims at</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a community of scholars working on humanities research questions relying on a wide range of computational and quantitative approaches to humanities data in all its forms. We consider this community to be complementary to the digital humanities landscape. We actively seek, welcome, and encourage people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities to join. This includes, but is not limited to, scholars from underrepresented groups, different academic paths, and those who are contributing novel perspectives to the computational humanities landscape.</li>
<li>Promoting good practices through sharing “research stories”. Such good practices may include, for instance, the publication of code and data in order to support transparency and replication of studies; pre-registering research design to present theoretical justification, hypotheses, and proposed statistical analysis; or a redesign of the reviewing process for interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational approaches to answer questions relevant to the humanities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of interest</h3>
<p>We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications of statistical methods and machine learning to process, enrich and analyze humanities data, including new media and cultural heritage data;</li>
<li>Hypothesis-driven humanities research, simulations and generative models;</li>
<li>Development of new quantitative and empirical methods for humanities research;</li>
<li>Modeling bias, uncertainty, and conflicting interpretation in the humanities;</li>
<li>Evaluation methods, evaluation data sets and development of standards;</li>
<li>Formal, statistical or quantitative evaluation of categorization / periodization for humanities data;</li>
<li>Theoretical frameworks and epistemology for quantitative methods and computational humanities approaches;</li>
<li>Translation and transfer of methods from other disciplines, approaches to bridge humanistic and statistical interpretations;</li>
<li>Visualization, dissemination (incl. Open science) and teaching in computational humanities;</li>
<li>Potential and challenges of AI applications to humanities research.</li>
</ul>
<p>To gain further insight into paper topics, please also refer to the proceedings of previous years:<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/"> </a><a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/">CHR2020</a>,<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2989/"> </a><a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2989/">CHR2021</a>,<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/"> </a><a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/">CHR2022</a>,<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3558/"> </a><a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3558/">CHR2023</a>, <a href="https://2024.computational-humanities-research.org/cfp/">CHR2024</a>.</p>
<h3 id="venue">Venue</h3>
<p>The 2025 edition of the Computational Humanities Research conference will be hosted by Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH) at the University of Luxembourg. The conference will be held in person, with a virtual participation option available for those unable to attend on-site. More details will follow soon. We are committed to making CHR2025 accessible to all participants. CHR2025 offers a limited number of travel bursaries and registration fee waivers to support participation from students, early-career researchers, and scholars from underrepresented or low-income regions.</p>
<h3 id="important-dates">Important dates</h3>

<h3 id="submission-types">Submission types</h3>
<p><strong>Long Papers</strong>: up to <strong>5000</strong> words (ca. 10 pages, references, abstract and tables/illustrations excluded). Long papers report on completed, original and unpublished results. Brevity of argument is preferred. We welcome the use of appendices or other supplementary information.</p>
<p><strong>Short Papers</strong>: up to <strong>3000</strong> words (ca. 6 pages, references, abstract and tables/illustrations excluded). Short papers report on focused contributions, and may present work in progress. Short papers are presented either as short oral presentations or posters. We welcome the use of appendices or other supplementary information.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Talks</strong>: Submit an abstract of up to 750 words (excluding references, tables and illustrations) to give a 5 minute presentation during a lightning talks session. This format can be well suited for reporting work in progress, introducing ideas, preliminary results, or focused question-answer research. The presentations will be on site.</p>
<p><strong>Workshops</strong>: up to <strong>1500</strong> words. Workshops should be organized to be more interactive than the main conference. The workshops will take place before the conference, on December 9, 2025. Workshop proposals should describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>the aims and set up of the workshop,</li>
<li>the academic background for the work,</li>
<li>proposed length (e.g. half day or full day),</li>
<li>an outline of the day, including the types of activities,</li>
<li>the expected key outcomes,</li>

<h3 id="submission-instructions-and-review-process">Submission instructions and review process</h3>
<p>We welcome submissions from scholars of diverse backgrounds and particularly from under-represented groups.</p>
<p><strong>Contrarily to previous years, no extension of the submission deadline is planned for the 2025 edition.</strong></p>
<p>Submissions should be written in English and must be formatted according to the <a href="https://anthology.ach.org/resources/anthology-ch.zip">CHR LaTeX template</a>. We recommend working in the online environment Overleaf. To start using Overleaf, open the following template file, select &ldquo;Open as Template&rdquo;, and sign or create a new account: <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ach-proceedings-paper-template/znmzmfngrwpd">LaTeX Overleaf template</a>.</p>
<p>Submissions are to be submitted <strong>anonymously</strong>. All submissions will be refereed through a double-blind peer review process by at least three reviewers with final acceptance decisions made by the Programme Chairs. The review guidelines can be found <a href="/reviewer-instructions">here</a>.</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted as PDF documents via the EasyChair conference management system: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chr2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chr2025</a>.</p>
<p>At least one author of each accepted submission must register to the conference and present the paper or poster.</p>
<p>Accepted papers will be submitted for publication online through the <a href="https://anthology.ach.org/">Anthology of Computers and the Humanities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="instructions-for-paper-anonymization">Instructions for paper anonymization</h3>
<p>Any information which might help identify authors should be anonymized. To this end, please:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> do not include authors’ names and affiliations;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> use placeholders for code and data repositories, e.g.<a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/"> </a><a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/">https://anonymous.4open.science/</a>,<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/xxxxx;"> </a><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/xxxxx;">https://zenodo.org/record/xxxxx;</a></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> do not mention self-references in a way that can reveal the author’s identity, e.g. do not use “We previously demonstrated (Smith, 2002)” but “Smith (2022) previously demonstrated”;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> leave acknowledgements blank.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anonymity-period">Anonymity period</h3>
<p>The anonymity period runs until the notification of acceptance (September 18). To support double-blind review, authors are asked not to promote their submissions publicly (e.g. via social media, blogs, or mailing lists) during this period. However, CHR recognizes the importance of early visibility, particularly for early-career researchers and interdisciplinary collaborations. Authors may post preprints (e.g., on arXiv, Zenodo, HAL, institutional repositories) prior to submission, provided they do not link to these from the anonymized paper.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be instructed to ignore any external identifiers and focus strictly on the anonymized submission. We also encourage empirical feedback: reviewers will be asked if they believe they can identify the authors and why, to help us assess how anonymity functions in practice.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions?</h3>
<p>Contact the organisers if you have any questions, specific requirements or concerns: <a href="mailto:pc@computational-humanities-research.org" title="mailto:pc@computational-humanities-research.org">pc@computational-humanities-research.org</a> or drop us a line on the<a href="https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org"> </a><a href="https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org">discourse forum</a>.</p>
