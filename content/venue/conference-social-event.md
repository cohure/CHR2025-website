<h2 id = "conference-dinner-transport">Conference Dinner Transport</h2>

We can take you to the conference dinner by private bus that will leave from the [Ibis Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bdX1J2sBYkj5C33V8) in Belval at 7:15 PM. The return bus will depart from the restaurant at 10:30 PM back to Belval. If you wish to use this service, you need to register with us as places are limited. Please fill [this questionnaire](http://ulsurvey.uni.lu/index.php/617547?lang=en) which will remain open only as long as there are still available places.  

Otherwise, feel free to use public transport in Luxembourg which is free.
