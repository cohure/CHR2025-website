Denmark is an ideal country for cycling. There are not many (very) steep hills and there are many safe cycling paths. 
Urban conditions for cyclists are one of the best in the world and constantly being improved. 
Look out for the special cyclists’ routes (cykelruter) and cycle paths (cykelstier). [Read more about how to rent a bike](https://www.visitaarhus.com/areas-and-cities/aarhus/activities/aarhus-bike).
