Networking with fellow researchers is a key aspect of any conference, and this year's event is designed to foster meaningful connections. 
By providing a range of accommodation options and encouraging attendees to stay at the same hotels, we hope to create more opportunities for interaction outside of formal sessions. 
Whether traveling between venues, sharing a meal, or exploring cultural activities together, these shared experiences will enhance the conference community. Additionally, we have secured discounts at some of the pre-selected hotels to make your stay even more convenient.
