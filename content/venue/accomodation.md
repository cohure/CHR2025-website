There are several options for accommodation during your stay in Luxembourg. 

Two hotels are located directly on the University’s Belval Campus: Ibis Esch Belval and Residhome Luxembourg Esch-Belval. Conveniently located near the conferene venur, they are also close to the train station and bus stops, allowing you to have easy access to Luxembourg's other renowned destinations.

In addition, the surrounding area offers a variety of other hotels and Airbnb listings. For those interested in environmentally conscious travel, we also suggest accommodation certified with a national eco-label ([EcoLabel Luxembourg](https://www.ecolabel.lu/?geodir_search=1&stype=gd_place&s=+&snear=Near%3A+My+Location&spost_category%5B%5D=27&slabel%5B%5D=&sgeo_lat=49.5045365&sgeo_lon=5.9471235) for sustainability. 

Before booking, we recommend checking the distance between your accommodation and the Belval Campus. You can use [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com), the official website of the national railway company [CFL](https://www.cfl.lu), or the official website of the [Public Transport Administration](https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/) to plan your journey and estimate travel time.


**Please note**: Campus hotels have **limited availability**, and reservations are handled on a **first-come, first-served** basis.
