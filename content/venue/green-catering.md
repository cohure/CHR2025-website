Choosing green catering for a conference reflects a commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. Thus, we have collaborated with our partner [Dussmann](https://en.dussmann.lu/food-services) to provide a selection of locally sourced, organic, and seasonal food options. All the food is prepared within a 30km radius of Belval. A huge effort has also been made on waste management by simply avoiding any packaging and single-use dishware.
 
Here's a breakdown of what is on offer:
* More than half of the food is organic (fruits, selected vegetables, viennoiseries, oat milk, juices…) and/or from locally sourced products (mozzarella, milk, beef, ham, salami, pâté de campagne, eggs, selected vegetables, pastries, alcohol drinks including crémant, beer, and white wine served during the cocktail reception, natural spring water from Rosport located in the East of Luxembourg, etc.).
* Additionally, we are offering responsibly sourced seafood such as tuna, shrimp, and smoked trout, which all bear a MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) or Blue Ocean seafood label.
* You will find Fair Trade coffee, tea, and bananas.
  
To ensure all guests have safe and enjoyable meal options, a third of the food is vegetarian or vegan, and a selection of gluten-free products are available. Feel free to consult the catalog of the allergens onsite. 
 
Finally, all the left-overs of the conference will be packed into eco-friendly boxes and donated to participants of the conference or students of the University.
