## Luxembourg Learning Centre (LLC)
The Luxembourg Learning Centre (LLC) is the main university library and an architectural highlight of the Belval Campus. Inside, you can:
* Read paper journals in multiple languages
* Watch TV
* Use spaces to relax and chat: lounge, chill out rooms with floor cushions, chill out zone with comfortable chairs and sofas and a selection of comic books
* Workspace: box (individual), silent room, classic individual workspace 
* Use PC stations (with Eduroam network)
* Grab a coffee or a sandwich at Paul’s

The LLC is located in the heart of the Belval “City of Science” and is built within the steel structure of a former industrial warehouse. Its bold design—featuring a futuristic glass façade and open interior spaces—symbolizes openness, innovation, and inspiration. The patterned glass panels are not only decorative but also regulate the natural light entering the building. From inside, the open layout provides impressive and unexpected views of the surroundings, including the nearby preserved blast furnaces.
