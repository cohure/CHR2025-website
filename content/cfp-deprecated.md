In the arts and humanities, the use of computational, statistical, and 
mathematical approaches has considerably increased in recent years. This 
research is characterized by the use of formal methods and the construction 
of explicit, computational models. This includes quantitative, statistical 
approaches, but also more generally computational methods for processing 
and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these 
approaches. Despite the undeniable growth of this research area, 
many scholars still struggle to find suitable research-oriented venues to 
present and publish computational work that does not lose sight of 
traditional modes of inquiry in the arts and humanities. This is the 
scholarly niche that the CHR conference aims to fill. More precisely, the 
conference aims at


1. Building a community of scholars working on humanities research questions
   relying on a wide range of computational and quantitative approaches to
   humanities data in all its forms. We consider this community to be
   complementary to the digital humanities landscape. We actively seek, 
   welcome, and encourage people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and 
   identities to join. This includes, but is not limited to, scholars from underrepresented groups, different academic paths, and those who are contributing novel perspectives to the computational humanities landscape.


2. Promoting good practices through sharing “research stories”. Such good
   practices may include, for instance, the publication of code and data in
   order to support transparency and replication of studies; pre-registering
   research design to present theoretical justification, hypotheses, and
   proposed statistical analysis; or a redesign of the reviewing process for
   interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational approaches to answer
   questions relevant to the humanities.


### Topics of interest

We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including -- but
not limited to -- the following:

- Applications of statistical methods and machine learning to process, enrich and analyse humanities data, including new media and cultural heritage data; 
- Hypothesis-driven humanities research, simulations and generative models;
- Development of new quantitative and empirical methods for humanities research;
- Modeling bias, uncertainty, and conflicting interpretation in the humanities;
- Evaluation methods, evaluation data sets and development of standards;
- Formal, statistical or quantitative  evaluation of categorization / periodization;
- Theoretical frameworks and epistemology for quantitative methods and computational humanities approaches;
- Translation and transfer of methods from other disciplines, approaches to bridge humanistic and statistical interpretations;
- Visualisation, dissemination (incl. Open science) and teaching in computational humanities.
- Potential and challenges of AI applications to humanities research.

To gain further insight into paper topics, please also refer to the proceedings of previous years: [CHR2020](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/),
[CHR2021](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2989/), [CHR2022](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/), [CHR2023](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3558/).

### Venue

The 2024 edition of the Computational Humanities Research conference will be hosted by the [DIGHUMLAB](https://dighumlab.org/) and 
[Center for Humanities Computing, Aarhus University](https://chc.au.dk/). 
The conference will be a hybrid event with an option to attend in person in Aarhus, virtually, or a combination 
of the two. More details will follow soon.

### Submission types

**Long Papers**: up to **5000** words (ca. 10 pages, references, abstract and
   tables/illustrations excluded). Long papers report on completed, original and
   unpublished results. Brevity of argument is preferred. We welcome the use of
   appendices or other supplementary information.

**Short Papers**: up to **3000** words (ca. 6 pages, references, abstract and
   tables/illustrations excluded). Short papers report on focused
   contributions, and may present work in progress. Short papers are presented
   either as short oral presentations or posters. We welcome the use of
   appendices or other supplementary information.

**Lightning Talks**: Submit an abstract of up to 750 words (excluding references, 
   tables and illustrations) to give a 5 minute presentation 
   during a lightning talks session. This format can be well suited for reporting 
   work in progress, introducing ideas, preliminary results, or focused 
   question-answer research.
   
**Workshops**: up to **1500** words. Workshops should be organised to be more 
interactive than the main conference. The workshops will take place before the
conference, on 3 December. Workshop proposals should describe:
- the aims and set up of the workshop,
- the academic background for the work,
- proposed length (e.g. half day or full day),
- an outline of the day, including the types of activities,
- the expected key outcomes,
- a short bio of each organiser or presenter, including their name, affiliation, email address
- a plan for promoting the workshop to draw participants.
- specific requirements, including but not limited to special equipment (e.g. audio/video), software, physical space arrangements,
- any technical knowledge, skills, or experience participants should have prior to attending the workshop.

### Submission instructions and review process

We welcome submissions from scholars of diverse backgrounds and particularly from under-represented groups.

Submissions should be written in English and must be formatted according to the
[CHR latex
template](https://github.com/cohure/CHR2024-website/raw/main/data/chr2024_latex_template.zip)
(see instructions on the forum to get you started
[here](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/t/chr-latex-instructions/230)).

Submissions are to be submitted **anonymously**. All submissions will be refereed through
a double-blind peer review process by at least three reviewers with final
acceptance decisions made by the Programme Chairs.

Papers should be submitted as PDF documents via the EasyChair
conference management system: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chr2024.

At least one author of each accepted submission must register to the conference and
present the paper or poster.

Accepted papers will be submitted for publication online via the [CEUR-WS](http://ceur-ws.org/) 
Proceedings publication service. 

### Submission deadline details
An initial paper submission must be submitted to EasyChair by July 11.
No new submissions will be accepted after this deadline.
Existing submissions can be _updated_ until the final submission deadline of July 15.
While earlier versions of submission may be used to determine reviewer assignments,
only the final submission will be used within the review process itself.

### Instructions for paper anonymisation 

Any information which might help identify authors should be anonymized. To this
end, please:

1. do not include authors' names and affiliations;
2. use placeholders for code and data repositories, e.g.
   https://anonymous.4open.science/, https://zenodo.org/record/xxxxx;
3. do not mention self-references in a way that can reveal the author's
   identity, e.g. do not use "We previously demonstrated (Smith, 2002)" but
   "Smith (2022) previously demonstrated";
4. leave acknowledgements blank.

### Anonymity period

The anonymity period runs until the notification of acceptance (**September,
2024**). Preprints can be published after this date.
