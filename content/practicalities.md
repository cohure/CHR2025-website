### Presentations and slides upload

> Please note that you can only use the main laptop (running on Wondows 11) the organizers make available in each room. 

Therefore, we gently invite you to upload your slides (in PDF or PPT format) to this OneDrive folder at least 24 hours before your session is scheduled to take place. Make sure to add your file to your session’s subfolder and use a clear file name (including main presenter’s surname). [Are online presenters also expected to upload their slides? or are they doing screen sharing?]

On the day, please make sure to stick to your allotted time (Long papers: 15 minutes + 7.5 minutes Q&A; Short papers: 10 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A; Lightning talk = 3 minutes), and arrive to your session 10 minutes before schedule to ensure smooth set-up and a prompt start.

### Posters

Posters are to be A1 format [any helpful tips/info on where people can print in Lux?]. 
Set up will take place on the same day as the poster session (11th December) at [TIME] in the catering area (level 3, MSA). If possible, we ask for posters to please be left in place until the end of conference to allow all attendees the opportunity to view them. [Any other info - e.g. re: provision of tape etc?]
