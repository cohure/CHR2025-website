The CHR2025 [conference](https://anthology.ach.org/volumes/vol0003/) proceedings are now online, comprising 97 papers and adding up to almost 1,600 pages. It is also the first time that the proceedings of a CHR conference are published at a new venue. After having published the proceedings of the first five editions of CHR at [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](https://ceur-ws.org), we are very happy to announce that CHR has found a new publication venue in the recently launched [Anthology of Computers and the Humanities](https://anthology.ach.org) (ACH). Every paper now comes with its own DOI, making the proceedings more visible and easier to cite.

We have furthermore published the final version of the conference programme. We start on Tuesday 9 December with the pre-conference workshops. On Wednesday 10 December, the main conference will kick off. The next three days will be packed with two keynotes, eight double-track oral presentation sessions, a poster session, and a lightning talk session. Check out all details of the programme and start planning your CHR experience [here](/../programme).
