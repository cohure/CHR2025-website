The 6th edition of the Computational Humanities Research (CHR) conference will take place at the <a href="https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/">Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (CÂ²DH)</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni.lu/en/">University of Luxembourg</a> from <strong>9 to 12 December 2025</strong>.
<p>
<p>
Renowned for its focus on providing a dedicated venue for presenting computational work that bridges formal methods and traditional inquiry in the arts and humanities, the CHR conference offers a platform to explore computational, statistical, and mathematical approaches, alongside theoretical reflections on these methods. We look forward to continuing our discussions in Luxembourg!
