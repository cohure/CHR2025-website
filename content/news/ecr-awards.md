Thanks to the generous support of [Digital Scholar](https://digitalscholar.org/), CHR2025 will feature one Best Paper Award in each paper category — long and short papers. Each award includes a prize of 250 € and is reserved for papers whose main author or authors are early career researchers.

We look forward to recognizing innovative work by emerging voices in computational humanities!

These awards are intended to increase the visibility of early career researchers and affirm their central role in shaping the future of the field.
